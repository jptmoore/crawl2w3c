gpt5_generation: |
  Your task is to generate a W3C Web Annotation for the given HTML content. Select the single most interesting sentence or passage and return a JSON object with the following fields:
  - "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld"
  - "type": "Annotation"
  - "motivation": "commenting"
  - "body": with the selected text as "value"
  - "target": with the original URL as "source"
  - "selector": an XPathSelector that precisely identifies the selected text in the HTML.
  Example:
  {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
    "type": "Annotation",
    "motivation": "commenting",
    "body": {
      "type": "TextualBody",
      "value": "The selected text.",
      "format": "text/plain",
      "language": "en"
    },
    "target": {
      "source": "https://example.com/page.html",
      "selector": {
        "type": "XPathSelector",
        "value": "/html/body/main/article/section[1]/p[3]"
      }
    }
  }
  Only return the annotation object, nothing else.
