gpt5_generation: |
  Your task is to generate a W3C AnnotationPage for the given HTML content. Identify ONLY substantial, informative content that provides meaningful information.
  
  SELECTION CRITERIA - Only annotate content that meets ALL of these requirements:
  1. Contains at least 2-3 complete sentences (minimum ~50 characters of actual text)
  2. Provides substantive information (biographical data, descriptions, explanations, articles, documentation)
  3. Is from the main content area (NOT navigation, headers, footers, menus, or UI elements)
  
  DO NOT annotate:
  - Page titles, site names, or navigation labels (e.g., "Artists – Rewind")
  - Single words or short phrases
  - Menu items, button text, or links
  - Copyright notices, footer text
  - Headings without accompanying descriptive text
  - Metadata labels without values
  
  Each annotation should have:
  - "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld"
  - "id": a unique identifier in the format "urn:sha256:[hash]" where [hash] is the SHA256 hash of (page_url + selected_text + xpath_selector)
  - "type": "Annotation"
  - "motivation": "commenting"
  - "creator": the annotation creator (use "urn:openai:gpt-5")
  - "body": with the selected text as "value"
  - "target": with the original URL as "source"
  - "selector": an XPathSelector that precisely identifies the selected text in the HTML.
  
  Return an AnnotationPage like this:
  {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
    "type": "AnnotationPage",
    "items": [
      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
        "id": "urn:sha256:abc123def456...",
        "type": "Annotation",
        "motivation": "commenting",
        "creator": "urn:openai:gpt-5",
        "body": {
          "type": "TextualBody",
          "value": "This is a substantial paragraph containing multiple sentences with meaningful biographical or descriptive information about the subject.",
          "format": "text/plain",
          "language": "en"
        },
        "target": {
          "source": "https://example.com/page.html",
          "selector": {
            "type": "XPathSelector",
            "value": "/html/body/main/article/section[1]/p[1]"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  
  If the page has no substantial content meeting these criteria, return an empty AnnotationPage with no items:
  {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
    "type": "AnnotationPage",
    "items": []
  }
  
  Only return the AnnotationPage object, nothing else.


gpt5_content_selection: |
  Your task is to determine if the HTML content of a page contains information worth annotating.
  
  You will receive the URL followed by processed HTML content from the page.
  
  Analyze the content and decide if it contains substantial, meaningful information that should be preserved as annotations. Look for biographical data, descriptions, metadata, articles, documentation, or other informative content.
  
  Skip pages that are:
  - Navigation/menu pages with only links
  - Empty or stub pages with minimal content
  - Pure link lists without descriptive content
  - Error pages or "not found" pages
  - Login/registration pages
  - Search results pages
  
  Return ONLY a JSON object:
  {
    "decision": "archive" | "skip",
    "reason": "<Brief explanation of why this content should be archived or skipped>"
  }


gpt5_url_selection: |
  Your task is to decide whether a URL is suitable for archiving. 
  User input: a single URL string.
  Do NOT fetch the URL. Decide suitability using only the string.
  Return ONLY a JSON object of the form:

  {
    "URL": "<The URL>"
    "decision": "archive" | "skip",
  }
