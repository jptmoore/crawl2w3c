gpt5_generation: |
  Your task is to generate a W3C AnnotationPage for the given HTML content AND extract entities (especially artists, people, organizations, and works) for RAG purposes.
  
  SELECTION CRITERIA - Only annotate content that meets ALL of these requirements:
  1. Contains at least 2-3 complete sentences (minimum ~50 characters of actual text)
  2. Provides substantive information (biographical data, descriptions, explanations, articles, documentation)
  3. Is from the main content area (NOT navigation, headers, footers, menus, or UI elements)
  
  DO NOT annotate:
  - Page titles, site names, or navigation labels (e.g., "Artists – Rewind")
  - Single words or short phrases
  - Menu items, button text, or links
  - Copyright notices, footer text
  - Headings without accompanying descriptive text
  - Metadata labels without values
  
  Each annotation should have:
  - "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld"
  - "id": a unique identifier in the format "urn:sha256:[hash]" where [hash] is the SHA256 hash of (page_url + selected_text + xpath_selector)
  - "type": "Annotation"
  - "motivation": "commenting"
  - "creator": the annotation creator (use "urn:openai:gpt-5")
  - "body": with the selected text as "value"
  - "target": with the original URL as "source"
  - "selector": an XPathSelector that precisely identifies the selected text in the HTML.
  
  ENTITY EXTRACTION:
  Extract entities ONLY from the text that you include in the annotations (the "value" fields in the annotation bodies).
  Do NOT extract entities from content you choose not to annotate.
  
  Extract these entity types:
  - Artists (painters, musicians, performers, etc.)
  - People (names of individuals)
  - Organizations (galleries, museums, institutions, bands, labels)
  - Works (titles of artworks, albums, songs, exhibitions)
  - Locations (cities, venues, galleries)
  
  For each entity provide:
  - "name": the entity name as it appears in the annotated text
  - "type": one of ["artist", "person", "organization", "work", "location", "other"]
  
  Return a JSON object with BOTH annotations and entities:
  {
    "annotationPage": {
      "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
      "type": "AnnotationPage",
      "items": [
        {
          "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
          "id": "urn:sha256:abc123def456...",
          "type": "Annotation",
          "motivation": "commenting",
          "creator": "urn:openai:gpt-5",
          "body": {
            "type": "TextualBody",
            "value": "This is a substantial paragraph containing multiple sentences with meaningful biographical or descriptive information about the subject.",
            "format": "text/plain",
            "language": "en"
          },
          "target": {
            "source": "https://example.com/page.html",
            "selector": {
              "type": "XPathSelector",
              "value": "/html/body/main/article/section[1]/p[1]"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "entities": [
      {
        "name": "Pablo Picasso",
        "type": "artist",
        "context": "Pabl
      },
      {
        "name": "Museum of Modern Art",
        "type": "organization
    ]
  }
  
  If the page has no substantial content, return empty arrays:
  {
    "annotationPage": {
      "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
      "type": "AnnotationPage",
      "items": []
    },
    "entities": []
  }
  
  Only return the JSON object with annotationPage and entities, nothing else.


gpt5_content_selection: |
  Your task is to determine if the HTML content of a page contains information worth annotating.
  
  You will receive the URL followed by processed HTML content from the page.
  
  Analyze the content and decide if it contains substantial, meaningful information that should be preserved as annotations. Look for biographical data, descriptions, metadata, articles, documentation, or other informative content.
  
  Skip pages that are:
  - Navigation/menu pages with only links
  - Empty or stub pages with minimal content
  - Pure link lists without descriptive content
  - Error pages or "not found" pages
  - Login/registration pages
  - Search results pages
  
  Return ONLY a JSON object:
  {
    "decision": "archive" | "skip",
    "reason": "<Brief explanation of why this content should be archived or skipped>"
  }


gpt5_url_selection: |
  Your task is to decide whether a URL is suitable for archiving. 
  User input: a single URL string.
  Do NOT fetch the URL. Decide suitability using only the string.
  Return ONLY a JSON object of the form:

  {
    "URL": "<The URL>"
    "decision": "archive" | "skip",
  }
